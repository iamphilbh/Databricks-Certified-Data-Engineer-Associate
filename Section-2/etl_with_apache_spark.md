# Section 2: ETL with Apache Spark

## 1. Extract data from a single file and from a directory of files

### Example 1: Reading a Single CSV File

```python
# Define the file path
file_path = "/mnt/data/sample_file.csv"

# Read the data into a Spark DataFrame
df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load(file_path)

# Show the DataFrame
df.show()
```

### Example 2: Reading a Single JSON File
```python
# Define the file path
file_path = "/mnt/data/sample_file.json"`

# Read the data into a Spark DataFrame
df = spark.read.format("json").load(file_path)

# Show the DataFrame
df.show()
```

## 2. Identify the prefix included after the FROM keyword as the data type

The prefix after the `FROM` keyword serves as an indicator of the data type Spark is querying:

* If it’s a **table** or **view**, the data type corresponds to that table or view.  
* If it’s a **file path**, the data type is determined by the format of the files stored in that path (e.g., CSV, Parquet).  
* If it’s a **data source format** like `delta` or `parquet`, the data type is explicitly declared as the format specified by the prefix.

This prefix allows Spark to understand how to access and interpret the data for querying and processing.

## 3. Create a view, a temporary view, and a CTE as a reference to a file

* **View:** A persistent, reusable query result that is stored in Databricks and can be queried like a table.
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW my_view AS SELECT * FROM csv.`/mnt/data/sample_file.csv`;
    ```
* **Temporary View:** A session-scoped view created in a single session, available only during the session's lifetime.
    ```python
    df.createOrReplaceTempView("temp_view")
    ```
* **CTE (Common Table Expression):** A temporary result set used within a single query, scoped only to that query.
    ```sql
    WITH my_cte AS (SELECT * FROM csv.`/mnt/data/sample_file.csv`) SELECT * FROM my_cte;
    ```

These options provide flexibility in referencing and querying data in files across various use cases.

### **Identify that tables from external sources are not Delta Lake tables**

Running the following code will show the provider field that can be delta if it’s a delta lake table  
``WITH my_cte AS (SELECT * FROM csv.`/mnt/data/sample_file.csv`) DESCRIBE EXTENDED table_name``

### **Create a table from a JDBC connection and from an external CSV file**

In Databricks, you can create a table from both a JDBC connection and an external CSV file using Apache Spark's built-in functions. Below are the detailed steps and examples for both scenarios.

### **1\. Create a Table from a JDBC Connection**

To create a table from a JDBC connection, you need to specify the JDBC URL, connection properties (such as the database user and password), and the SQL query to pull data from the external database.

#### **Example: Create a Table from a JDBC Connection**

`# Define JDBC connection properties`  
`jdbc_url = "jdbc:mysql://your-database-host:3306/your-database-name"`  
`connection_properties = {`  
    `"user": "your-username",`  
    `"password": "your-password",`  
    `"driver": "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"`  
`}`

`# Load data from the external database using a JDBC connection`  
`jdbc_df = spark.read.jdbc(url=jdbc_url, table="your_table_name", properties=connection_properties)`

`# Create a table in Databricks from the JDBC data`  
`jdbc_df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("my_jdbc_table")`

In this example:

* `jdbc_url` specifies the JDBC connection string (in this case, to a MySQL database).  
* The `connection_properties` dictionary contains the username, password, and JDBC driver details.  
* Data is loaded into a Spark DataFrame using the `spark.read.jdbc()` method.  
* The resulting DataFrame is saved as a table in Databricks using `saveAsTable()`.

### **2\. Create a Table from an External CSV File**

To create a table from an external CSV file, you specify the file path, load the data into a DataFrame, and then save it as a table in Databricks.

#### **Example: Create a Table from an External CSV File**

`# Load data from the external CSV file into a DataFrame`  
`csv_file_path = "/mnt/data/sample_file.csv"`

`csv_df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").option("inferSchema", "true").load(csv_file_path)`

`# Create a table in Databricks from the CSV data`  
`csv_df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("my_csv_table")`

In this example:

* `csv_file_path` specifies the path to the external CSV file (stored in Databricks File System or external storage like Azure Blob Storage or S3).  
* Data is loaded into a Spark DataFrame using the `spark.read.format("csv")` method, with options to specify headers and schema inference.  
* The resulting DataFrame is saved as a table in Databricks using `saveAsTable()`.

### **Summary:**

* **Creating a Table from JDBC Connection:** You use `spark.read.jdbc()` to read data from an external database using a JDBC connection and then save it as a table using `saveAsTable()`.  
* **Creating a Table from a CSV File:** You use `spark.read.format("csv")` to read data from a CSV file into a DataFrame, then save the DataFrame as a table in Databricks using `saveAsTable()`.

Both methods allow you to bring external data into Databricks and make it available for querying and analysis.

### **Identify how the count\_if function and the count where x is null can be used**

- count\_if(condition)  
- SELECT count\_if(amount \> 1000\) AS count\_large\_sales FROM sales;  
- SELECT count\_if(price IS NULL) AS count\_null\_prices FROM sales;

### **Identify how the count(row) skips NULL values**

### **Summary:**

* **`COUNT(*)`:** Counts all rows, regardless of `NULL` values.  
* **`COUNT(column_name)`:** Counts only the rows where the specified column has non-`NULL` values. Rows with `NULL` in the specified column are skipped.

### **Deduplicate rows from an existing Delta Lake table**

To deduplicate rows from an existing Delta Lake table in Databricks, you can use the `MERGE`, `DELETE`, or `INSERT OVERWRITE` commands, depending on the nature of your dataset and the deduplication strategy you want to apply. Below, I'll show the most common method using the `MERGE` statement, which is a powerful way to remove duplicates from a Delta Lake table.

### **Steps to Deduplicate Rows from a Delta Lake Table**

### **1\. Deduplication using `MERGE`**

The `MERGE` command is useful when you want to merge a deduplicated version of the dataset into the existing table.

#### **Example: Deduplicate Using `MERGE`**

Suppose you have a Delta Lake table `sales_data` and you want to remove duplicate rows based on a unique identifier column called `order_id`. You can use `MERGE` to deduplicate rows like this:

`MERGE INTO sales_data AS target`  
`USING (`  
  `SELECT order_id, MAX(amount) AS amount, MAX(customer_id) AS customer_id`  
  `FROM sales_data`  
  `GROUP BY order_id`  
`) AS source`  
`ON target.order_id = source.order_id`  
`WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET *`  
`WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *`

* **Explanation:**  
  * The `MERGE` command merges the results of a deduplicated version of the table back into the original table.  
  * The `source` query selects unique rows by `order_id` using `GROUP BY`, retaining only the first occurrence of each `order_id`. Aggregation functions (e.g., `MAX()`) can be used for non-key columns.  
  * `ON target.order_id = source.order_id` ensures that the rows are matched based on the unique `order_id`.  
  * `UPDATE SET *` updates the target table with deduplicated values if a match is found.  
  * `INSERT *` inserts new rows if they don't already exist in the target table.  
    

### **2\. Deduplication using Window Functions and `INSERT OVERWRITE`**

Another approach involves using window functions to rank rows within partitions based on a unique identifier and then writing back the deduplicated data using `INSERT OVERWRITE`.

#### **Example: Deduplicate Using Window Function and `INSERT OVERWRITE`**

python  
Copier le code  
`from pyspark.sql.window import Window`  
`from pyspark.sql.functions import row_number`

`# Read the Delta Lake table into a DataFrame`  
`df = spark.read.format("delta").table("sales_data")`

`# Define a window specification to partition by 'order_id' and order by a column (e.g., 'timestamp')`  
`window_spec = Window.partitionBy("order_id").orderBy("timestamp")`

`# Add a row number column based on the window specification`  
`df_with_row_number = df.withColumn("row_number", row_number().over(window_spec))`

`# Filter the DataFrame to keep only the first row in each partition (i.e., the deduplicated data)`  
`deduplicated_df = df_with_row_number.filter(df_with_row_number["row_number"] == 1).drop("row_number")`

`# Overwrite the Delta Lake table with the deduplicated data`  
`deduplicated_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("sales_data")`

* **Explanation:**  
  * A window function (`row_number()`) is used to assign a unique number to each row within a partition of `order_id`, based on a timestamp or any other relevant ordering column.  
  * Only the first occurrence of each partition (the row with `row_number = 1`) is retained, which effectively removes duplicates.  
  * The deduplicated DataFrame is written back to the Delta Lake table using the `overwrite` mode.

### **3\. Deduplication using `DELETE` and `DISTINCT`**

For simple use cases, you can use `DELETE` with a `ROW_NUMBER()` window function or `DISTINCT` to filter duplicates and then write back to the table.

#### **Example: Deduplicate Using `DELETE`**

sql

Copier le code

`DELETE FROM sales_data`

`WHERE order_id IN (`

    `SELECT order_id`

    `FROM (`

        `SELECT order_id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY order_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS row_number`

        `FROM sales_data`

    `) temp`

    `WHERE row_number > 1`

`);`

* **Explanation:**  
  * This query partitions the data by `order_id` and assigns a row number to each row in the partition.  
  * The `DELETE` statement removes all rows where the row number is greater than 1, keeping only the first occurrence for each partition.

### **4\. Deduplication Using `DISTINCT` and Overwriting the Table**

You can also use the `DISTINCT` keyword to remove duplicates and then overwrite the Delta table with the deduplicated data.

#### **Example: Deduplicate Using `DISTINCT`**

python

Copier le code

`# Read the Delta table into a DataFrame`

`df = spark.read.format("delta").table("sales_data")`

`# Deduplicate using the distinct method`

`deduplicated_df = df.dropDuplicates(["order_id"])`

`# Overwrite the table with the deduplicated data`

`deduplicated_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("sales_data")`

* **Explanation:**  
  * The `dropDuplicates()` method in PySpark is used to retain only the first occurrence of each unique `order_id`.  
  * The deduplicated data is written back to the Delta table using the `overwrite` mode.

### **Validate that the primary key is unique across all rows**

To validate that a primary key is unique across all rows in a Delta Lake table, you can use several approaches depending on whether you want to check this constraint programmatically or enforce it within the data pipeline. Below, I'll walk through a common approach using SQL and PySpark to validate the uniqueness of a primary key.

### **1\. Validation Using SQL**

In Spark SQL, you can validate that the primary key column is unique by checking for duplicates using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`. If the primary key is unique, the query should return no rows; if there are duplicates, the query will return the duplicated primary key values.

#### **Example: Validate Uniqueness with SQL**

Assume you have a Delta Lake table called `orders` with a primary key column named `order_id`.

`SELECT order_id, COUNT(*) AS occurrences`  
`FROM orders`  
`GROUP BY order_id`  
`HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;`

* **Explanation:**  
  * This query groups the data by `order_id` and counts the occurrences of each `order_id`.  
  * The `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` clause filters out the rows where the count is greater than 1, which would indicate duplicate primary key values.  
  * If the result set is empty, then the `order_id` column is unique across all rows. If it returns rows, those represent the duplicate primary key values.

### **2\. Validation Using PySpark**

You can also validate primary key uniqueness programmatically in PySpark. This method involves checking for duplicates by counting the occurrences of the primary key and filtering out those with more than one occurrence.

#### **Example: Validate Uniqueness with PySpark**

`from pyspark.sql import functions as F`

`# Load the Delta Lake table into a DataFrame`  
`df = spark.read.format("delta").table("orders")`

`# Group by the primary key column and count occurrences`  
`duplicate_check_df = df.groupBy("order_id").agg(F.count("*").alias("occurrences"))`

`# Filter rows where the primary key occurs more than once`  
`duplicates_df = duplicate_check_df.filter(duplicate_check_df["occurrences"] > 1)`

`# Show the duplicates if any`  
`duplicates_df.show()`

* **Explanation:**  
  * This code groups the DataFrame by `order_id` and counts the number of rows for each unique value of `order_id`.  
  * The `filter()` function is used to identify any rows where the count is greater than 1, indicating duplicate primary keys.  
  * If `duplicates_df` is empty, then the `order_id` column is unique.

### **3\. Validation with Integrity Checks Using Assertions**

You can also enforce uniqueness within your pipeline by using assertions. This ensures that no duplicates are present before further processing.

#### **Example: Validate with an Assertion**

`# Calculate the total number of rows and the number of distinct primary keys`  
`total_rows = df.count()`  
`distinct_keys = df.select("order_id").distinct().count()`

`# Validate uniqueness by comparing total rows with distinct primary keys`  
`assert total_rows == distinct_keys, "Primary key constraint violated: Duplicates found in order_id"`

* **Explanation:**  
  * `total_rows` counts the total number of rows in the DataFrame.  
  * `distinct_keys` counts the distinct values in the `order_id` column.  
  * The assertion compares the two counts. If the total number of rows is greater than the number of distinct primary keys, it means there are duplicates, and the assertion will raise an error.

### **4\. Enforce Primary Key Uniqueness During Data Ingestion**

To enforce primary key uniqueness during data ingestion or as part of an ETL pipeline, you can leverage Delta Lake's `MERGE` command with a `WHEN MATCHED` clause. This will ensure that only one row per primary key is inserted or updated in the target table.

#### **Example: Enforce Uniqueness Using `MERGE`**

`MERGE INTO target_table AS target`  
`USING source_table AS source`  
`ON target.order_id = source.order_id`  
`WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET *`  
`WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *;`

* **Explanation:**  
  * This query ensures that for each `order_id`, only one row is inserted into the `target_table`. If a row with the same `order_id` already exists, it is updated instead of inserted again, thereby preventing duplicate primary keys.

### **5\. Using Delta Lake Constraints (Databricks SQL)**

Delta Lake has added support for constraints, including **CHECK** constraints and **NOT NULL** constraints. While Delta Lake currently doesn't support primary key constraints directly, you can enforce similar logic using SQL and validation techniques during your pipeline.

#### **Example: Using Constraints**

You can set up a `CHECK` constraint during table creation to enforce certain validation rules (though note that Delta Lake doesn't yet support enforcing primary key constraints natively).

`CREATE TABLE orders (`  
  `order_id INT,`  
  `customer_id INT,`  
  `amount DOUBLE,`  
  `CONSTRAINT positive_amount CHECK (amount > 0)`  
`) USING delta;`

### **Summary:**

* **SQL Validation:** Use `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to identify rows where the primary key is not unique.  
* **PySpark Validation:** Programmatically group by the primary key and filter out duplicates, then check for any violations.  
* **Assertion:** Programmatically assert that the number of total rows equals the number of distinct primary keys.  
* **Enforcement During Ingestion:** Use Delta Lake’s `MERGE` to ensure uniqueness during data ingestion by merging rows based on the primary key.  
* **Delta Lake Constraints:** While Delta Lake does not natively support primary key constraints, you can implement similar validations using SQL and logic within your pipeline.

These methods ensure that the primary key remains unique across all rows in your Delta Lake tables.

### **Validate that a field is associated with just one unique value in another field**

To validate that a field is associated with exactly one unique value in another field, you can group the data by the first field and then check if it has more than one associated value in the second field. This can be achieved using SQL or PySpark, and the steps generally involve counting the distinct values in the second field for each unique value in the first field.

### **1\. Validation Using SQL**

You can use a combination of `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to check if any field has more than one unique value in another field.

#### **Example: Validate a One-to-One Association with SQL**

Suppose you have a table `employees` with columns `employee_id` and `department_id`. You want to ensure that each `employee_id` is associated with exactly one unique `department_id`.

`SELECT employee_id, COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) AS unique_department_count`  
`FROM employees`  
`GROUP BY employee_id`  
`HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) > 1;`

* **Explanation:**  
  * The query groups the data by `employee_id` and counts the distinct `department_id` values for each `employee_id`.  
  * The `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) > 1` clause filters out any `employee_id` that is associated with more than one `department_id`.  
  * If the result set is empty, it means that each `employee_id` is associated with exactly one unique `department_id`. If any rows are returned, those are the `employee_id` values that violate the uniqueness constraint.

### **2\. Validation Using PySpark**

In PySpark, you can use similar logic to check for one-to-one associations between fields.

#### **Example: Validate a One-to-One Association with PySpark**

`from pyspark.sql import functions as F`

`# Load the table into a DataFrame`  
`df = spark.read.format("delta").table("employees")`

`# Group by employee_id and count distinct department_id for each employee`  
`validation_df = df.groupBy("employee_id").agg(F.countDistinct("department_id").alias("unique_department_count"))`

`# Filter to identify employee_id that are associated with more than one department_id`  
`violations_df = validation_df.filter(validation_df["unique_department_count"] > 1)`

`# Show the violations, if any`  
`violations_df.show()`

* **Explanation:**  
  * The DataFrame is grouped by `employee_id`, and the number of distinct `department_id` values is counted for each employee.  
  * The `filter()` function is used to check for rows where an `employee_id` has more than one associated `department_id`.  
  * If `violations_df` is empty, it means all `employee_id`s are associated with exactly one `department_id`. Otherwise, it will display the rows where the constraint is violated.

### **3\. Validation with Assertion in PySpark**

You can also programmatically validate the association using an assertion to ensure that every field in `employee_id` is associated with exactly one unique value in `department_id`.

#### **Example: Assertion for One-to-One Association in PySpark**

`# Count the total number of employee_id and the number of employee_id with a single department_id`  
`total_employees = df.select("employee_id").distinct().count()`  
`valid_associations = validation_df.filter(validation_df["unique_department_count"] == 1).count()`

`# Assert that all employee_id have a unique department_id`  
`assert total_employees == valid_associations, "Some employee_id are associated with more than one department_id"`

* **Explanation:**  
  * First, the total number of distinct `employee_id`s is calculated.  
  * Then, you filter for `employee_id`s that are associated with exactly one unique `department_id` and count them.  
  * An assertion is used to ensure that all `employee_id`s have valid associations. If the assertion fails, it indicates that some `employee_id`s are associated with more than one `department_id`.

### **Summary of Approaches:**

* **SQL Validation:** Use `GROUP BY` with `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` and `HAVING` to identify rows where a field is associated with more than one unique value in another field.  
* **PySpark Validation:** Group by the first field and count distinct values of the second field, filtering for violations where more than one unique value is found.  
* **Assertion in PySpark:** Programmatically check that the count of valid one-to-one associations matches the total number of distinct rows and raise an assertion if the condition is not met.

These methods help ensure that each field is consistently associated with only one unique value in another field, enforcing a one-to-one relationship between them.

### **Validate that a value is not present in a specific field**

To validate that a specific value is **not present** in a specific field in Databricks or Spark SQL, you can use a `NOT EXISTS`, `NOT IN`, or filtering approach in SQL or PySpark. This method allows you to check if the field contains any instances of the undesired value and, if so, flag it for further action.

Here’s how you can perform this validation.

### **1\. Validation Using SQL**

In SQL, you can use a `SELECT` query with the `NOT EXISTS` or `NOT IN` clauses to check if a specific value is present in a field.

#### **Example: Validation Using `NOT EXISTS`**

Suppose you have a table `employees` with a field `department_id`, and you want to check that the value `999` is **not present** in the `department_id` column.

`SELECT COUNT(*) AS value_present`  
`FROM employees`  
`WHERE department_id = 999;`

* **Explanation:**  
  * This query checks if any rows have `department_id = 999`.  
  * If the result returns `0`, then the value `999` is not present in the `department_id` field.  
  * If the result is greater than `0`, it indicates that the value `999` exists in the field.

Alternatively, you can use `NOT EXISTS` or `NOT IN` to validate.

#### **Example: Validation Using `NOT IN`**

`SELECT *`  
`FROM employees`  
`WHERE department_id NOT IN (999);`

* **Explanation:**  
  * This query will return all rows where the value `999` does not appear in the `department_id` column.  
  * If the query returns fewer rows than the original table, it means that some rows had `department_id = 999`.

### **2\. Validation Using PySpark**

In PySpark, you can validate that a specific value is not present in a field by filtering the DataFrame.

#### **Example: Validation in PySpark**

Suppose you have a DataFrame `df` with a field `department_id`, and you want to ensure that the value `999` is not present.

`# Filter the DataFrame to check if any rows have department_id = 999`  
`invalid_rows_df = df.filter(df["department_id"] == 999)`

`# Show the rows where department_id is 999 (if any)`  
`invalid_rows_df.show()`

`# Count the number of invalid rows`  
`invalid_row_count = invalid_rows_df.count()`

`# Check if the value is present`  
`if invalid_row_count == 0:`  
    `print("Validation passed: Value 999 is not present in department_id.")`  
`else:`  
    `print(f"Validation failed: Value 999 is present in {invalid_row_count} rows.")`

* **Explanation:**  
  * This script filters the DataFrame to find rows where `department_id` equals `999`.  
  * The `count()` function checks how many rows match this condition. If the count is `0`, the value `999` is not present in the column.  
  * Depending on the result, the script outputs whether the validation passed or failed.

### **3\. Assertion-Based Validation in PySpark**

You can also use assertions to automatically validate the presence of a value in the DataFrame.

#### **Example: Assertion Validation in PySpark**

`# Count the total number of rows where department_id is 999`  
`invalid_row_count = df.filter(df["department_id"] == 999).count()`

`# Assert that there are no rows with department_id = 999`  
`assert invalid_row_count == 0, f"Validation failed: Value 999 is present in {invalid_row_count} rows."`

* **Explanation:**  
  * This script uses an assertion to enforce that no rows contain the value `999` in the `department_id` field. If the assertion fails, it indicates that the value is present and raises an error with a descriptive message.

### **4\. Validation Using `NOT EXISTS` in SQL**

You can also use the `NOT EXISTS` clause to perform the validation by looking for the absence of a value.

#### **Example: Using `NOT EXISTS`**

`SELECT *`  
`FROM employees e`  
`WHERE NOT EXISTS (`  
    `SELECT 1`   
    `FROM employees`   
    `WHERE department_id = 999`  
`);`

* **Explanation:**  
  * This query checks if any rows exist where `department_id` equals `999`.  
  * If no rows are found, the query returns the full table. If rows are found, they will be excluded from the result, helping identify the presence of the value.

### **Summary:**

* **SQL Validation:** Use a `SELECT` query with a `WHERE` clause to check if a specific value is present. If no rows are returned, the value is not present.  
* **PySpark Validation:** Filter the DataFrame to check if the specific value exists in the column, then count the matching rows to determine if the value is present.  
* **Assertion Validation:** Programmatically assert that the value is not present by checking that the count of matching rows is `0`.

These methods allow you to validate that a specific value is not present in a column, ensuring data integrity and correctness.

### **Cast a column to a timestamp**

In Databricks and PySpark, casting a column to a `timestamp` is commonly used to convert string or numeric data into a timestamp format that Spark can recognize for time-based operations like filtering, aggregation, or time-series analysis.

Here’s how to cast a column to a `timestamp` in both SQL and PySpark.

### **1\. Casting a Column to `timestamp` in SQL**

You can use the `CAST` or `TO_TIMESTAMP` function in SQL to convert a column to the `timestamp` data type.

#### **Example 1: Using `CAST` in SQL**

Assume you have a table `events` with a column `event_time` stored as a string (e.g., `"2024-10-01 12:30:00"`), and you want to cast it to a `timestamp`.

`SELECT CAST(event_time AS timestamp) AS event_timestamp`  
`FROM events;`

* **Explanation:**  
  * This query casts the `event_time` column to the `timestamp` data type, returning the result as `event_timestamp`.

#### **Example 2: Using `TO_TIMESTAMP` in SQL**

Alternatively, you can use `TO_TIMESTAMP`, which converts a string to a `timestamp`.

`SELECT TO_TIMESTAMP(event_time, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss') AS event_timestamp`  
`FROM events;`

* **Explanation:**  
  * `TO_TIMESTAMP` converts the `event_time` column, which is a string, into a `timestamp` format based on the specified format string (`'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'`).

### **2\. Casting a Column to `timestamp` in PySpark**

In PySpark, you can use the `cast()` function to convert a column to a `timestamp` data type, or you can use the `to_timestamp()` function for more explicit formatting.

#### **Example 1: Using `cast()` in PySpark**

`from pyspark.sql import functions as F`

`# Assume df is the DataFrame with a column 'event_time' as string`  
`df = df.withColumn("event_timestamp", df["event_time"].cast("timestamp"))`

`# Show the DataFrame with the new timestamp column`  
`df.show()`

* **Explanation:**  
  * The `cast("timestamp")` method is used to convert the `event_time` column to the `timestamp` data type. The result is saved in a new column called `event_timestamp`.

#### **Example 2: Using `to_timestamp()` in PySpark**

If your timestamp column is in a specific string format, you can use `to_timestamp()` for conversion.

`from pyspark.sql import functions as F`

`# Convert the 'event_time' column to a timestamp format using a specific format`  
`df = df.withColumn("event_timestamp", F.to_timestamp(df["event_time"], "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"))`

`# Show the DataFrame with the new timestamp column`  
`df.show()`

* **Explanation:**  
  * `to_timestamp()` takes two arguments: the column to convert and the format string that specifies the format of the input string.  
  * The column `event_time` is converted to a timestamp based on the specified format and stored in the new column `event_timestamp`.

### **3\. Handling Different Formats**

If your input string format differs from the standard format, you can specify the exact format using `TO_TIMESTAMP` in SQL or `to_timestamp()` in PySpark.

#### **Example with a Different Format**

`# Example where the string format is different, e.g., 'MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss'`  
`df = df.withColumn("event_timestamp", F.to_timestamp(df["event_time"], "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss"))`

`# Show the DataFrame with the new timestamp column`  
`df.show()`

### **Summary:**

* **In SQL**, you can use `CAST` or `TO_TIMESTAMP` to convert columns to a `timestamp`.  
* **In PySpark**, use the `cast("timestamp")` method or the `to_timestamp()` function to convert columns to the `timestamp` type.  
* For custom string formats, specify the format in `TO_TIMESTAMP` (SQL) or `to_timestamp()` (PySpark) to ensure proper conversion.

These methods are useful for converting date and time strings into Spark’s `timestamp` type for further analysis and processing.

### **Extract calendar data from a timestamp**

Extracting calendar data (such as the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, etc.) from a `timestamp` column in Databricks SQL or PySpark allows you to break down the timestamp into its individual components for various time-based analyses.

Here’s how to extract calendar data from a timestamp in both SQL and PySpark.

### **1\. Extracting Calendar Data in SQL**

In Databricks SQL (or Spark SQL), you can use various built-in date functions to extract different parts of a timestamp.

#### **Example: Extracting Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, and Second in SQL**

`SELECT`   
    `YEAR(event_timestamp) AS year,`  
    `MONTH(event_timestamp) AS month,`  
    `DAY(event_timestamp) AS day,`  
    `HOUR(event_timestamp) AS hour,`  
    `MINUTE(event_timestamp) AS minute,`  
    `SECOND(event_timestamp) AS second`  
`FROM events;`

* **Explanation:**  
  * `YEAR(event_timestamp)`: Extracts the year from the `timestamp`.  
  * `MONTH(event_timestamp)`: Extracts the month from the `timestamp`.  
  * `DAY(event_timestamp)`: Extracts the day of the month from the `timestamp`.  
  * `HOUR(event_timestamp)`: Extracts the hour from the `timestamp`.  
  * `MINUTE(event_timestamp)`: Extracts the minute from the `timestamp`.  
  * `SECOND(event_timestamp)`: Extracts the second from the `timestamp`.

These functions allow you to break down the `timestamp` into individual components for detailed time-based analysis.

### **2\. Extracting Calendar Data in PySpark**

In PySpark, you can use functions from the `pyspark.sql.functions` module to extract different parts of a timestamp.

#### **Example: Extracting Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, and Second in PySpark**

`from pyspark.sql import functions as F`

`# Assume df is a DataFrame with a timestamp column 'event_timestamp'`  
`df = df.withColumn("year", F.year("event_timestamp")) \`  
       `.withColumn("month", F.month("event_timestamp")) \`  
       `.withColumn("day", F.dayofmonth("event_timestamp")) \`  
       `.withColumn("hour", F.hour("event_timestamp")) \`  
       `.withColumn("minute", F.minute("event_timestamp")) \`  
       `.withColumn("second", F.second("event_timestamp"))`

`# Show the DataFrame with the extracted columns`  
`df.show()`

* **Explanation:**  
  * `F.year("event_timestamp")`: Extracts the year from the `timestamp`.  
  * `F.month("event_timestamp")`: Extracts the month from the `timestamp`.  
  * `F.dayofmonth("event_timestamp")`: Extracts the day of the month from the `timestamp`.  
  * `F.hour("event_timestamp")`: Extracts the hour from the `timestamp`.  
  * `F.minute("event_timestamp")`: Extracts the minute from the `timestamp`.  
  * `F.second("event_timestamp")`: Extracts the second from the `timestamp`.

Each column in the DataFrame now contains the extracted component from the original `timestamp`.

### **3\. Other Useful Calendar Functions**

In addition to extracting the common calendar components, you might also want to extract other useful date and time components, such as the day of the week, day of the year, or week of the year.

#### **SQL Example: Extracting Day of the Week, Day of the Year, and Week of the Year**

`SELECT`   
    `DAYOFWEEK(event_timestamp) AS day_of_week,    -- Day of the week (1 = Sunday, 7 = Saturday)`  
    `DAYOFYEAR(event_timestamp) AS day_of_year,    -- Day of the year (1-365/366)`  
    `WEEKOFYEAR(event_timestamp) AS week_of_year  -- Week of the year (1-52/53)`  
`FROM events;`

#### **PySpark Example: Extracting Day of the Week, Day of the Year, and Week of the Year**

`df = df.withColumn("day_of_week", F.dayofweek("event_timestamp")) \`  
       `.withColumn("day_of_year", F.dayofyear("event_timestamp")) \`  
       `.withColumn("week_of_year", F.weekofyear("event_timestamp"))`

`# Show the DataFrame with the extracted columns`  
`df.show()`

* **Explanation:**  
  * `F.dayofweek("event_timestamp")`: Extracts the day of the week (1 \= Sunday, 7 \= Saturday).  
  * `F.dayofyear("event_timestamp")`: Extracts the day of the year (1-365/366).  
  * `F.weekofyear("event_timestamp")`: Extracts the week of the year (1-52/53).

### **Summary:**

* **In SQL**, you can use functions like `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DAY()`, `HOUR()`, `MINUTE()`, and `SECOND()` to extract components from a `timestamp`.  
* **In PySpark**, you can use functions like `F.year()`, `F.month()`, `F.dayofmonth()`, `F.hour()`, `F.minute()`, and `F.second()` to extract these components.  
* You can also extract more granular time data like `day_of_week`, `day_of_year`, and `week_of_year` for more complex time-based analysis.

These methods enable you to break down `timestamp` data into individual calendar components for detailed insights and analysis in Databricks and PySpark.

### **Extract a specific pattern from an existing string column**

To extract a specific pattern from an existing string column in Databricks or PySpark, you can use the `regexp_extract` function. This function allows you to extract substrings that match a regular expression pattern from a given string column.

Here’s how to extract a specific pattern using SQL and PySpark.

### **1\. Extracting a Specific Pattern Using SQL**

In SQL, the `regexp_extract` function is used to extract a substring that matches a regular expression from a string column.

#### **Syntax:**

`regexp_extract(string, pattern, idx)`

* `string`: The string column from which you want to extract the pattern.  
* `pattern`: The regular expression pattern to match.  
* `idx`: The capture group index. `0` returns the entire match, while `1`, `2`, etc. refer to specific capture groups in the regular expression.

#### **Example: Extracting a Phone Number Pattern**

Assume you have a table `contacts` with a column `contact_info`, and you want to extract phone numbers in the format `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`.

`SELECT contact_info,`   
       `regexp_extract(contact_info, '\\((\\d{3})\\) \\d{3}-\\d{4}', 0) AS phone_number`  
`FROM contacts;`

* **Explanation:**  
  * `\\((\\d{3})\\) \\d{3}-\\d{4}` is the regular expression pattern to match phone numbers in the format `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`.  
  * The `0` index returns the entire matched string.  
  * If you want to extract just the area code, for example, you can use `1` to refer to the first capture group.

### **2\. Extracting a Specific Pattern Using PySpark**

In PySpark, you can use the `regexp_extract()` function from the `pyspark.sql.functions` module to extract a pattern from a string column.

#### **Syntax:**

`regexp_extract(column, pattern, idx)`

* `column`: The string column from which you want to extract the pattern.  
* `pattern`: The regular expression pattern to match.  
* `idx`: The capture group index. `0` returns the entire match, while `1`, `2`, etc. refer to specific capture groups in the regular expression.

#### **Example: Extracting a Phone Number Pattern**

Assume you have a PySpark DataFrame `df` with a column `contact_info`, and you want to extract phone numbers in the format `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`.

`from pyspark.sql import functions as F`

`# Define the pattern for phone numbers`  
`pattern = r'\((\d{3})\) \d{3}-\d{4}'`

`# Extract the phone number from the contact_info column`  
`df = df.withColumn("phone_number", F.regexp_extract("contact_info", pattern, 0))`

`# Show the DataFrame with the extracted phone numbers`  
`df.show()`

* **Explanation:**  
  * The regular expression pattern `r'\((\d{3})\) \d{3}-\d{4}'` matches phone numbers in the format `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`.  
  * `regexp_extract()` extracts the entire matched phone number and stores it in a new column called `phone_number`.

### **3\. Example with Multiple Capture Groups**

Suppose you want to extract multiple parts of a string, such as separating the area code from the phone number.

#### **SQL Example with Multiple Capture Groups:**

`SELECT contact_info,`   
       `regexp_extract(contact_info, '\\((\\d{3})\\)', 1) AS area_code,`  
       `regexp_extract(contact_info, '\\((\\d{3})\\) (\\d{3})-\\d{4}', 2) AS phone_part`  
`FROM contacts;`

* **Explanation:**  
  * `\\((\\d{3})\\)` captures the area code `(XXX)` as group 1\.  
  * `\\((\\d{3})\\) (\\d{3})-\\d{4}` captures the next part of the phone number `(XXX) XXX-XXXX` where group 2 is the `XXX` portion of the phone number.

#### **PySpark Example with Multiple Capture Groups:**

`# Extract the area code and phone part separately`  
`df = df.withColumn("area_code", F.regexp_extract("contact_info", r'\((\d{3})\)', 1))`  
`df = df.withColumn("phone_part", F.regexp_extract("contact_info", r'\((\d{3})\) (\d{3})-\d{4}', 2))`

`# Show the DataFrame with the extracted values`  
`df.show()`

* **Explanation:**  
  * The area code is extracted as group 1 from the pattern `r'\((\d{3})\)'`.  
  * The phone part is extracted as group 2 from the pattern `r'\((\d{3})\) (\d{3})-\d{4}'`.

### **Summary:**

* **In SQL**, use `regexp_extract()` to extract specific patterns from a string column based on a regular expression. You can specify which part of the match (the whole match or specific groups) to extract.  
* **In PySpark**, use the `regexp_extract()` function from the `pyspark.sql.functions` module to achieve the same result.  
* You can extract complex patterns by using multiple capture groups in your regular expressions and extracting specific parts of the string.

This technique is useful for parsing and cleaning string data, such as extracting phone numbers, email addresses, or other formatted strings from larger text columns.

### **Utilize the dot syntax to extract nested data fields**

In Databricks and PySpark, you can use **dot syntax** to extract nested fields from complex data structures such as JSON, structs, or arrays. Dot syntax allows you to access and manipulate nested fields directly.

Here’s how you can work with nested data fields using dot syntax in both SQL and PySpark.

### **1\. Extracting Nested Data Fields Using SQL**

In Spark SQL, you can access nested fields of complex data types (such as `struct`, `array`, or `map`) by using dot notation.

#### **Example: Extracting Nested Fields from a Struct in SQL**

Assume you have a table `users` with a column `user_info` that is a struct containing nested fields like `name.first_name`, `name.last_name`, and `address.city`.

`SELECT`   
    `user_info.name.first_name AS first_name,`  
    `user_info.name.last_name AS last_name,`  
    `user_info.address.city AS city`  
`FROM users;`

* **Explanation:**  
  * The `user_info` column contains a struct, and you can access its nested fields directly by using dot notation.  
  * The nested fields `name.first_name`, `name.last_name`, and `address.city` are extracted and returned as individual columns.

### **2\. Extracting Nested Data Fields Using PySpark**

In PySpark, you can access nested fields using dot notation as well. This is commonly used when dealing with structured or semi-structured data formats such as JSON or Parquet.

#### **Example: Extracting Nested Fields from a Struct in PySpark**

Assume you have a DataFrame `df` with a column `user_info` that is a struct containing fields like `name.first_name`, `name.last_name`, and `address.city`.

`# Select the nested fields using dot notation`  
`df.select(`  
    `"user_info.name.first_name",`  
    `"user_info.name.last_name",`  
    `"user_info.address.city"`  
`).show()`

* **Explanation:**  
  * The nested fields `name.first_name`, `name.last_name`, and `address.city` are accessed using dot notation.  
  * The `select()` function extracts these fields and creates a new DataFrame with those columns.

#### **Example: Extracting Nested Fields from JSON in PySpark**

Assume you have a JSON column `user_json` that contains nested fields. You can first parse the JSON data into a struct, then use dot notation to access the nested fields.

`from pyspark.sql import functions as F`

`# Assume the 'user_json' column is a string containing JSON data`  
`df = df.withColumn("user_info", F.from_json("user_json", schema))`

`# Now access the nested fields using dot notation`  
`df.select(`  
    `"user_info.name.first_name",`  
    `"user_info.name.last_name",`  
    `"user_info.address.city"`  
`).show()`

* **Explanation:**  
  * First, you use `from_json()` to parse the JSON string into a struct based on a predefined schema.  
  * Then, you use dot notation to access the nested fields within the struct.

### **3\. Working with Arrays and Maps Using Dot Syntax**

You can also use dot syntax to extract fields from arrays and maps.

#### **Example: Extracting Data from an Array Using Dot Syntax**

Assume you have an array of structs in a column `orders` and you want to extract the first order’s `order_id` and `amount`.

`# Extract the first order's fields using dot notation with array indexing`  
`df.select(`  
    `"orders[0].order_id",`  
    `"orders[0].amount"`  
`).show()`

* **Explanation:**  
  * The `orders` column contains an array of structs, and you can access the first element using `[0]` followed by dot notation to access the fields within that struct.  
  * This extracts the `order_id` and `amount` fields of the first order in the array.

#### **Example: Extracting Data from a Map Using Dot Syntax**

Assume you have a map column `product_map` where the keys are product IDs and the values are structs containing product details. You want to extract the `name` and `price` of a specific product (e.g., `product_123`).

`# Extract the name and price of a specific product using dot notation with map keys`  
`df.select(`  
    `"product_map['product_123'].name",`  
    `"product_map['product_123'].price"`  
`).show()`

* **Explanation:**  
  * The `product_map` column is a map, and you can access the value associated with a specific key (e.g., `'product_123'`) using square brackets.  
  * After accessing the specific product, you can use dot notation to extract fields like `name` and `price`.

### **Summary:**

* **Dot Syntax in SQL:** You can use dot notation to extract nested fields from complex data types like `struct` or `array` in Spark SQL. Example: `SELECT user_info.name.first_name FROM users;`  
* **Dot Syntax in PySpark:** Use dot notation in PySpark to select and manipulate nested fields within a DataFrame. Example: `df.select("user_info.name.first_name").show()`.  
* **Arrays and Maps:** Dot notation also works with arrays and maps, allowing you to access specific elements and fields. Example: `df.select("orders[0].order_id").show()`.

Dot syntax is a powerful way to work with nested data, making it easy to access and manipulate fields within complex data structures.

### **Identify the benefits of using array functions**

Array functions in Databricks and PySpark provide powerful tools for manipulating arrays, which are commonly used for handling and processing collections of elements within a single row. These functions simplify working with arrays by offering a wide range of operations, from basic element access to advanced transformations. The use of array functions offers several key benefits:

### **1\. Simplified Data Processing**

Array functions allow you to process and transform array data directly within SQL queries or PySpark operations. Instead of having to manually iterate over elements or flatten data structures, array functions provide a streamlined way to manipulate arrays.

**Example:** Suppose you have a column `scores` that contains an array of integers. You can easily calculate the sum, average, or other aggregations directly on the array without needing to unnest or flatten the data.  
`SELECT array_sum(scores) AS total_score`  
`FROM students;`

In PySpark:  
`df = df.withColumn("total_score", F.expr("aggregate(scores, 0, (acc, x) -> acc + x)"))`

### **2\. Handling Nested Data**

Array functions are essential when working with nested data, such as arrays within arrays or arrays of structs. These functions allow you to easily navigate and transform nested structures, which is common in semi-structured data formats like JSON or Parquet.

**Example:** You have an array of structs representing customer orders. Array functions allow you to extract specific fields from each struct in the array, process the data, and then return the results in a transformed array.  
`SELECT transform(orders, o -> o.order_id) AS order_ids`  
`FROM customers;`

### **3\. Efficient Parallelization**

Working with arrays allows for parallelized operations on the elements, improving efficiency and performance when dealing with large datasets. Spark’s distributed nature ensures that array operations are efficiently handled across the cluster.

* **Benefit:** By using array functions like `map`, `filter`, or `aggregate`, Spark can process the elements of an array in parallel across multiple nodes, improving performance when working with large collections of data.

### **4\. In-Place Transformations**

Array functions provide an easy way to apply transformations to the elements of an array, such as filtering, mapping, or reducing, without the need to explode and reconstruct the array.

**Example:** If you want to filter out negative values from an array, you can use the `filter` function directly on the array:  
`SELECT filter(scores, x -> x > 0) AS positive_scores`  
`FROM students;`

In PySpark:  
`df = df.withColumn("positive_scores", F.expr("filter(scores, x -> x > 0)"))`

### **5\. Flexibility in Data Aggregation**

Array functions allow for flexible aggregation of data within an array. You can easily calculate summaries, find minimum and maximum values, or apply custom logic across the elements.

**Example:** Calculate the total sales for each customer based on an array of individual transactions:  
`SELECT customer_id, array_sum(transactions) AS total_sales`  
`FROM customer_sales;`

In PySpark:  
`df = df.withColumn("total_sales", F.expr("aggregate(transactions, 0, (acc, x) -> acc + x)"))`

### **6\. Reducing Complexity in Data Engineering Tasks**

Array functions help reduce complexity when working with complex data structures. Instead of writing cumbersome code to iterate over elements and manage transformations manually, you can use built-in array functions that provide concise and expressive operations.

**Example:** You have a list of tags stored in an array and want to extract all the unique tags across a dataset. The `array_distinct` function simplifies this task:  
`SELECT array_distinct(flatten(tags)) AS unique_tags`  
`FROM articles;`

In PySpark:  
`df = df.withColumn("unique_tags", F.array_distinct(F.flatten("tags")))`

### **7\. Handling Missing or Null Data**

Array functions offer a way to manage missing or null data within arrays, ensuring that your data transformations are robust and resilient to incomplete data.

**Example:** You can use `array_remove` to remove `null` values from an array:  
`SELECT array_remove(scores, NULL) AS clean_scores`  
`FROM students;`

In PySpark:  
`df = df.withColumn("clean_scores", F.expr("filter(scores, x -> x IS NOT NULL)"))`

### **8\. Concatenating and Combining Arrays**

Array functions provide built-in methods for concatenating and combining arrays, making it easy to merge data from multiple columns or datasets into a single array for further processing.

**Example:** If you have two arrays, `orders_2023` and `orders_2024`, you can combine them into one array:  
`SELECT array_union(orders_2023, orders_2024) AS all_orders`  
`FROM customer_orders;`

In PySpark:  
`df = df.withColumn("all_orders", F.array_union("orders_2023", "orders_2024"))`

### **9\. Readability and Maintainability**

Array functions make your code more readable and maintainable by providing a declarative approach to manipulating arrays. Instead of writing complex loops or manual processing, you can express the logic using high-level array functions, improving code clarity.

### **Summary:**

The benefits of using array functions in Databricks and PySpark include:

* Simplified data processing and transformation.  
* Efficient handling of nested and complex data structures.  
* Parallelized operations for improved performance.  
* In-place transformations without the need for exploding arrays.  
* Flexible data aggregation and custom logic.  
* Reduced complexity in handling arrays within data pipelines.  
* Built-in methods for managing null values and concatenating arrays.

Array functions offer a powerful and efficient way to work with complex data structures in Spark, making data engineering tasks more straightforward and expressive.

### **Parse JSON strings into structs**

To parse JSON strings into structs in Databricks or PySpark, you use the `from_json()` function. This function converts a JSON string column into a struct data type based on a predefined schema, allowing you to work with the parsed data as individual fields.

### **Steps to Parse JSON Strings into Structs:**

1. **Define a Schema:** Specify the structure of the JSON data using `StructType` and `StructField`.  
2. **Use `from_json()` Function:** Apply the `from_json()` function to convert the JSON string column into a struct based on the schema.  
3. **Access Struct Fields:** After parsing, you can access the individual fields in the struct using dot notation.

### **Example in PySpark:**

`from pyspark.sql import functions as F`  
`from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType`

`# Define the schema`  
`schema = StructType([`  
    `StructField("name", StringType(), True),`  
    `StructField("age", IntegerType(), True)`  
`])`

`# Parse JSON string into struct`  
`df = df.withColumn("parsed_json", F.from_json("json_column", schema))`

`# Access fields from the struct`  
`df.select("parsed_json.name", "parsed_json.age").show()`

### **Summary:**

* **`from_json()`**: Parses JSON strings into struct columns.  
* **Schema Definition**: A schema is required to define the structure of the JSON data.  
* **Dot Notation**: After parsing, individual fields are accessible using dot notation.

### **Identify which result will be returned based on a join query**

### **Summary of Join Types and Results:**

1. **INNER JOIN**:  
   * **Result**: Only rows with matching values in both tables.  
   * **Example**: Returns orders with matching customers.  
2. **LEFT JOIN**:  
   * **Result**: All rows from the left table, and matching rows from the right table (with `NULL`s for non-matches).  
   * **Example**: Returns all orders, even those without a matching customer.  
3. **RIGHT JOIN**:  
   * **Result**: All rows from the right table, and matching rows from the left table (with `NULL`s for non-matches).  
   * **Example**: Returns all customers, even if there are no matching orders.  
4. **FULL OUTER JOIN**:  
   * **Result**: All rows from both tables, with `NULL`s for non-matching rows from either table.  
   * **Example**: Returns all customers and orders, regardless of matches.  
5. **CROSS JOIN**:  
   * **Result**: Cartesian product of both tables (all combinations of rows).  
   * **Example**: Every row from `orders` paired with every row from `customers`.

### **Identify a scenario to use the explode function versus the flatten function**

### **Scenario for Using `explode`:**

* **Use Case**: When you have a column containing arrays and you want to **transform each element of the array into a separate row**.  
* **Example**: You have a column of customer purchases, where each row contains an array of items. `explode` would output one row per item for each customer.

### **Scenario for Using `flatten`:**

* **Use Case**: When you have a column containing **arrays of arrays**, and you want to **combine them into a single array** without changing the row structure.  
* **Example**: You have a column of nested arrays (e.g., list of orders, each containing multiple item arrays), and you want to flatten the nested structure into one continuous array per row.

### **Summary:**

* **`explode`**: Converts arrays into individual rows.  
* **`flatten`**: Merges nested arrays into one array per row.

### **Identify the PIVOT clause as a way to convert data from a long format to a wide format**

### **PIVOT Clause:**

* **Use Case**: Converts data from long format (many rows for each category) to wide format (fewer rows with more columns).

**Example**: Transform sales data with multiple rows per product into a single row per product with columns for each sales region.  
`SELECT *`   
`FROM sales_data`   
`PIVOT (SUM(sales) FOR region IN ('East', 'West', 'North', 'South'));`

### **Define a SQL UDF**

**Definition**: A SQL UDF is a custom function that you define and use in SQL queries to encapsulate logic that can be reused across queries.  
**Example**:  
`CREATE FUNCTION my_udf(x INT) RETURNS INT`  
`RETURN x * 2;`

**Usage**: `SELECT my_udf(sales) FROM sales_data;`

### **Identify the location of a function**

To identify the location of a function in Databricks SQL or Spark SQL, it typically refers to determining where the function is defined or resides. This can be categorized as:

1. **Built-In Functions**: These are native to the system and are part of the SQL engine, such as `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`. They reside within the database system and are available globally without any explicit definition or reference.  
2. **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**:  
   * **SQL UDFs**: Created and stored in the database. You can identify their location by checking the schema or catalog in which they are defined.  
   * **Python/Scala UDFs**: Defined within your notebook or scripts, and their location is within the code where they are defined and executed.

### **Example (SQL UDF Location):**

`` SHOW FUNCTIONS IN my_database;  -- Lists all functions, including UDFs in `my_database` ``

* **Location**: The function resides in the schema (or database) where it was created.

### **Describe the security model for sharing SQL UDFs**

When sharing SQL User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in Databricks or any SQL-based platform, security is critical to ensure that access to the UDFs is properly controlled. Here's how the security model typically works:

1. **Schema-Level Permissions**:  
   * **UDFs are stored in schemas**: When you create a SQL UDF, it is stored in a specific schema or database. To access the UDF, a user must have permission to access the schema where the UDF is located.  
   * **Granting permissions**: You can control access to the UDF by granting or revoking privileges (such as `USAGE` or `EXECUTE`) on the schema or function level. This ensures that only authorized users can execute the UDF.  
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
   * **Role-based access**: You can manage access to UDFs through roles and privileges. Administrators can assign roles to users or groups that dictate who can create, execute, or manage UDFs.  
   * **Fine-grained control**: For example, an admin can grant `EXECUTE` permissions on a specific UDF to a group of users while restricting other users from executing the function.  
3. **Data Access Considerations**:  
   * **Data Security**: SQL UDFs can access data within the database, so access to sensitive UDFs must be limited to users who have appropriate permissions to the data the UDF might work with.  
   * **Audit and Monitoring**: It's important to monitor and audit UDF usage to ensure that only authorized users are executing the UDFs and that they are accessing data appropriately.  
4. **UDF Sharing Across Workspaces**:  
   * **Limited by Workspace Boundaries**: Typically, UDFs are scoped to a specific workspace or environment and are not automatically shareable across different workspaces unless explicitly set up by administrators through shared catalogs or federated access models.

### **Summary:**

* **Schema and Role-Based Permissions**: Access to UDFs is governed by schema-level permissions and role-based access controls (RBAC).  
* **Granular Permissions**: You can grant or revoke permissions like `EXECUTE` on UDFs to ensure only authorized users can use them.

### **Use CASE/WHEN in SQL code**

The `CASE/WHEN` statement in SQL is used to implement conditional logic within a query. It allows you to specify conditions and return different results based on those conditions, similar to an `if-else` statement in programming.

### **Syntax:**

`CASE`  
    `WHEN condition1 THEN result1`  
    `WHEN condition2 THEN result2`  
    `...`  
    `ELSE result_default`  
`END`

* `condition1`, `condition2`: Conditions to evaluate.  
* `result1`, `result2`: Values to return when the corresponding condition is true.  
* `result_default`: Default value to return if none of the conditions are met.

### **Example: Use of `CASE/WHEN` in SQL**

Assume you have a table `sales` with a column `amount` and you want to categorize the sales as 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low' based on the value of `amount`.

`SELECT`   
    `amount,`  
    `CASE`   
        `WHEN amount > 1000 THEN 'High'`  
        `WHEN amount BETWEEN 500 AND 1000 THEN 'Medium'`  
        `ELSE 'Low'`  
    `END AS sale_category`  
`FROM sales;`

* **Explanation**:  
  * If the `amount` is greater than 1000, the `sale_category` will be 'High'.  
  * If the `amount` is between 500 and 1000, it will be 'Medium'.  
  * Otherwise, it will be categorized as 'Low'.

### **Result Example:**

| amount | sale\_category |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1200 | High |
| 800 | Medium |
| 400 | Low |

This flexibility allows you to handle complex logic directly within your SQL queries.

### **Leverage CASE/WHEN for custom control flow**

The `CASE/WHEN` statement in SQL is not just used for conditional column selection, but it can also be leveraged for **custom control flow** within SQL queries. This allows you to introduce complex logic, perform conditional calculations, and execute actions based on specific criteria directly within the query.

### **Use Case: Custom Control Flow with `CASE/WHEN`**

You can use `CASE/WHEN` to define multiple branches of logic in your query, like applying different calculations based on conditions, categorizing data, or even filtering results conditionally.

### **Example: Custom Control Flow in SQL**

Assume you have a table `orders` with columns `order_id`, `order_date`, and `amount`. You want to apply different discount rates based on the order amount and use `CASE/WHEN` to decide the appropriate discount.

`SELECT`   
    `order_id,`  
    `amount,`  
    `CASE`   
        `WHEN amount > 1000 THEN amount * 0.9    -- 10% discount for amounts > 1000`  
        `WHEN amount BETWEEN 500 AND 1000 THEN amount * 0.95  -- 5% discount for amounts between 500 and 1000`  
        `ELSE amount  -- No discount for amounts less than 500`  
    `END AS final_amount`  
`FROM orders;`

* **Explanation**:  
  * If `amount` is greater than 1000, a 10% discount is applied.  
  * If `amount` is between 500 and 1000, a 5% discount is applied.  
  * Otherwise, no discount is applied.

### **Example: Conditional Aggregation with `CASE/WHEN`**

You can also use `CASE/WHEN` to perform conditional aggregation, which allows for flexible grouping and calculation based on different conditions.

`SELECT`   
    `COUNT(CASE WHEN amount > 1000 THEN 1 END) AS high_value_orders,`  
    `COUNT(CASE WHEN amount BETWEEN 500 AND 1000 THEN 1 END) AS medium_value_orders,`  
    `COUNT(CASE WHEN amount < 500 THEN 1 END) AS low_value_orders`  
`FROM orders;`

* **Explanation**:  
  * This query counts the number of high, medium, and low-value orders by applying different conditions within the `CASE/WHEN` statement.

### **Example: Conditional Filtering with `CASE/WHEN`**

In some cases, you might want to dynamically filter results based on a condition using `CASE/WHEN`.

`SELECT`   
    `order_id,`  
    `amount,`  
    `CASE`   
        `WHEN amount > 1000 THEN 'Priority'`  
        `WHEN amount BETWEEN 500 AND 1000 THEN 'Standard'`  
        `ELSE 'Low Priority'`  
    `END AS order_priority`  
`FROM orders`  
`WHERE CASE`   
        `WHEN amount > 1000 THEN TRUE`  
        `ELSE FALSE`  
    `END;`

* **Explanation**:  
  * This query categorizes orders by priority and only includes orders where the amount is greater than 1000 (i.e., 'Priority' orders). The filtering logic is controlled using `CASE/WHEN`.

### **Summary:**

* **Custom Calculations:** Apply different formulas or transformations based on conditions.  
* **Conditional Aggregations:** Group or aggregate data conditionally based on multiple criteria.  
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Conditionally filter data by controlling which rows are included in the results.

`CASE/WHEN` allows you to introduce complex decision-making logic directly into your SQL queries, making your queries more dynamic and responsive to various conditions.
